This code defines a functional component called App, which uses several modules to create a histogram chart of the frequency distribution of words in a remote text file.

The useState hook is used to create a state variable called histogramData, which is initialized as an empty array. The fetchData function is an asynchronous function that uses the axios module to make a GET request to a text file hosted on a remote server. The response data is then processed to obtain the frequency distribution of words. The sortedFrequency array is sorted in descending order of frequency and then sliced to contain only the top 20 words. The resulting array is mapped into an array of objects containing the word and its frequency, which is then set as the value of histogramData state variable.

The handleExport function is used to create a CSV file containing the data displayed in the histogram chart and to trigger a file download when the user clicks the "Export" button. The saveAs function from the file-saver module is used to initiate the download.

The return statement of the App component returns a button that calls the fetchData function when clicked. If histogramData state variable is not empty, the histogram chart is rendered using the BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, and Legend components from the recharts module. A second button is rendered to allow the user to export the data as a CSV file.



The libraries and plugins used in this code are:

React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
useState - A hook provided by React to manage state in functional components.
file-saver - A library to save files on the client-side.
axios - A library for making HTTP requests from the browser.
recharts - A composable charting library built on top of React components, used to render the histogram chart in this code. The specific components used from Recharts are:
BarChart - The main chart component that renders the histogram chart.
CartesianGrid - A component that renders the Cartesian grid of the chart.
XAxis - A component that renders the X-axis of the chart.
YAxis - A component that renders the Y-axis of the chart.
Tooltip - A component that renders a tooltip when hovering over the chart.
Legend - A component that renders the legend of the chart.
Bar - A component that renders a bar in the chart.
